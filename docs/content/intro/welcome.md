# What Is Mesanine?

Mesanine Linux is a minimalist container-oriented Linux distribution based on [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org) that is designed around the [Apache Mesos](https://mesos.apache.org) ecosystem. Mesanine favors minimalism and a container-first approach. It is assembled with [LinuxKit](https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit).
