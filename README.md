## What Is Mesanine?

Mesanine is a container oriented Linux distribution for running a diverse range of workloads on [Apache Mesos](https://mesos.apache.org). It is designed to be minimal, secure, and simple to manage. Mesanine is built from the ground up with the [LinuxKit](https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit) platform from the [Moby](https://github.com/moby/tool) project. We are actively looking for feedback and contributors! Please feel free to open up an [issue](https://github.com/mesanine/mesanine/issues) on Github.

**Mesanine is still in very early stages of development, and not yet suitable for real world use!**


### Why Are You Building Mesanine?

Mesos is arguably the most proven and powerful container orchestration and resource scheduler in the industry 
but it can also be very complicated and challenging to administer. Having maintained large Mesos installations 
for years we aim to improve and modernize some of the areas we consider challenging about existing platforms
and tooling.
